Sample input file for PB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Although, we tried to use the input files as recommended in the
Amber manual, some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations in a reasonable amount of time.
Feel free to change the parameters #according to what is better for your system.
