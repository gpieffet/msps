Molecular System Preparation Scripts

This an ensemble of scripts designed to facilitate and speed up the setup of molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules, proteins and protein - ligand complexes. The scripts were written to work with the Gromacs simulation package and as such are probably only useful if gromacs is already installed. The scripts are high level so it doesn't matter which version of gromacs you're running providing it's > 5.x.
